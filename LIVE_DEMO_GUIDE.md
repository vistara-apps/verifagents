# VerifAgents Live Demo Guide

**Quick reference for live demonstrations on X/Twitter or presentations**

---

## üé¨ Demo 1: Proof-of-Inference Market (2 minutes)

**What it shows**: Real AI model verification with on-chain receipts

### Setup (30 seconds)

```bash
cd modules/proof-of-inference-market

# Make sure .env is configured with:
# - OPENROUTER_API_KEY (your key)
# - WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY (test wallet)
# - RPC_URL (Base Sepolia)
```

### Run the Demo

```bash
./REAL_API_DEMO.sh
```

### What Happens

1. ‚úÖ **4 microservices start** (AVS, ML Agent, Payments, Receipts)
2. ‚úÖ **3 real GPT inferences**:
   - "What is 2 + 2?" ‚Üí Expects "4"
   - "Capital of France?" ‚Üí Expects "Paris"
   - "Is sky blue?" ‚Üí Expects "Yes"
3. ‚úÖ **Live verification** with confidence scores
4. ‚úÖ **On-chain receipt minting** (ERC-8004)
5. ‚úÖ **Payment processing** through smart contracts

### Key Talking Points

- "Every inference generates a verifiable receipt on Base Sepolia"
- "Confidence scores determine payment amounts"
- "Real EigenLayer AVS integration for ML verification"
- "Contract address: 0x8CbFbAc122D63B52796fbc7b967C09687Bc89BEc"
- "View receipts on BaseScan: https://sepolia.basescan.org/address/0x8CbFbAc122D63B52796fbc7b967C09687Bc89BEc"

### Expected Output

## ü§ñ Demo 2: Agent-to-Agent Payments (30 seconds)

**What it shows**: Trustless payments between autonomous agents

### Setup (10 seconds)

```bash
cd modules/agent-payments

# Optional: Set your own keys
export PAYER_PRIVATE_KEY="0x..."
export RECIPIENT_PRIVATE_KEY="0x..."
```

### Run the Demo

```bash
node real-two-agent-demo.js
```

### What Happens

1. ‚úÖ **Two agents initialized** (Payer & Recipient)
2. ‚úÖ **Collateral deposit** (0.005 ETH)
3. ‚úÖ **Payment tab created** (credit line established)
4. ‚úÖ **Payment signed** (EIP-712 signature)
5. ‚úÖ **Guarantee issued** (BLS certificate)
6. ‚úÖ **Payment claimed** (trustless remuneration)

### Key Talking Points

- "Sub-second payment guarantees with 4MICA protocol"
- "Cryptographic payment proofs with BLS signatures"
- "Agents operate autonomously without human intervention"
- "Real blockchain transactions on Holesky testnet"
- "Every payment generates ERC-8004 receipt for reputation"

### Expected Output
