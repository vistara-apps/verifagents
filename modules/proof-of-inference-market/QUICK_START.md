# Proof-of-Inference AVS - Quick Start Guide

## üöÄ Get Started in 3 Steps

### Step 1: Start All Services (30 seconds)
```bash
cd /Users/mayurchougule/development/ethereum/verifagents/modules/proof-of-inference-market
./start-all-services.sh
```

### Step 2: Run Demo (2 minutes)
```bash
cd demo
python3 end_to_end_demo.py
```

### Step 3: View Results
See cryptographic proofs generated for each test! ‚úÖ

## üìã What's Running

After Step 1, you'll have 4 services running:

| Service | Port | Purpose |
|---------|------|---------|
| AVS Orchestrator | 8082 | Coordinates entire workflow |
| ML Verification Agent | 8083 | Verifies AI inference |
| 4Mica Payment Service | 8084 | Handles payments |
| ERC-8004 Receipt Service | 8085 | Mints on-chain receipts |

---

## üîê Expected Proofs

Each test generates 3 cryptographic proofs:

1. **Verification Proof** - Hash of ML inference verification
2. **Attestation Hash** - AVS orchestrator's signature
3. **Payment/Receipt Proof** - Blockchain evidence

Example output:
```
üîê Verification Proof: 0x5172b6f83709511a05df37f854ff3a8ed575e3c4896682...
üîê Attestation Hash: 0x8a023c3518aba518fb5b80b9b359a5ba7440964e6534a8f...
```

---

## üõë Stop Services

```bash
./stop-all-services.sh
```

---

## üîß Optional: Enable Real API Calls

### For Real LLM Verification (95% confidence vs 70%)
```bash
# Get API key from https://openrouter.ai
export OPENROUTER_API_KEY="sk-or-v1-your_key_here"
./start-all-services.sh
```

### For Real Blockchain Transactions
```bash
# Get Base Sepolia ETH from https://www.alchemy.com/faucets/base-sepolia
# Send to: 0xf39Fd6e51aad88F6F4ce6aB8827279cffFb92266
./start-all-services.sh
```

## üè• Health Check

```bash
# Check all services
curl http://localhost:8082/health  # AVS
curl http://localhost:8083/health  # ML Agent
curl http://localhost:8084/health  # Payment
curl http://localhost:8085/health  # Receipt
```

---

## üìù View Logs

```bash
# Real-time logs for all services
tail -f logs/*.log

# Individual service logs
tail -f logs/avs-orchestrator.log
tail -f logs/ml-agent.log
tail -f logs/payment-service.log
tail -f logs/receipt-service.log
```

## üéØ Test Single Request

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8082/verify \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "requestId": 999,
    "modelId": "gpt-3.5-turbo",
    "inputData": "What is AI?",
    "expectedOutput": "AI is artificial intelligence",
    "actualOutput": "AI is artificial intelligence",
    "reward": "1000000000000000000",

  }'
```

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Services won't start?
```bash
# Kill any existing processes
./stop-all-services.sh
# Try again
./start-all-services.sh
```

### Demo fails with "Service not responding"?
```bash
# Wait 5 seconds for services to fully start
sleep 5
# Try demo again
cd demo && python3 end_to_end_demo.py
```

### Want more detailed output?
```bash
# Check the logs
cat logs/avs-orchestrator.log
```
